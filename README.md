Old-fashioned or exquisite corpse?
Background

Excerpted from the MoMALearning article linked here: Surrealist artists played a collaborative, chance-based parlor game, typically involving four players, called Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse). Each participant would draw an image (or, on some occasions, paste an image down) on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal their contribution, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution. [...] For the Surrealists, Exquisite Corpse was a perfect parlor game, involving elements of unpredictability, chance, unseen elements, and group collaboration—all in service of disrupting the waking mind’s penchant for order.

    Add a line of poetry to the number that's been assigned to you.

    Scroll down, name and summarize your commit, then click Propose Changes to the game-1.2 branch. This will automatically fork game-1.2 to your GitHub account.

    Check to see if your head repository — your-username/excquisite-corpose** can is set to be merged with the base repository (zmuhls/exquisite-corpse), then click Create pull request to merge your changes with game-1.2.

    Give your pull request a title, leave a comment if you want, then click Create pull request.

    If all goes well, I will see and accept your Pull request, then merge your fork with the game-1.2 branch. Once your changes have been successfully merged with game-1.2, I can then merge that branch with the main codespace.

And we're done!

Neat, right?

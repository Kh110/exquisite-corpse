# How about a game of exquisite corpse?

## Background

Excerpted from the MoMALearning article [linked here](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse): 

>Surrealist artists played a collaborative, chance-based parlor game, typically involving four players, called Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse). Each participant would draw an image (or, on some occasions, paste an image down) on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal their contribution, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution. [...] For the Surrealists, Exquisite Corpse was a perfect parlor game, involving elements of unpredictability, chance, unseen elements, and group collaboration—all in service of disrupting the waking mind’s penchant for order.

## How to play exquisite corpse on GitHub

1. Switch from the **main** codespace to the **game-1.2** branch (top-left corner of repo directly under **<>Code**)

2. In the game-1.2 branch, select **game.md** underneath the **README.md** file, then click the pencil icon to edit the file (top-right corner of the file).

3. Add a line of poetry to the number that's been assigned to you.

4. Name and summarize your commit, then click **Propose Changes** to the **game-1.2**. Doing so will automatically fork this branch of the repository to your account for you to then submit a **pull request** that I can review and merge with **game-1.2**.

5. Check to see if your **head repository** (your-username/excquisite-corpose) can be merged with the **base repository** (zmuhls/exquisite-corpse), then click **Create pull request** to propose merging your changes with **game-1.2**.

6. Give your pull request a title, leave a comment if you want, then click **Create pull request**. 

7. After I see and accept your pull request, your forked version and its modifications will merge with **game-1.2** in the **base repository**. 

8. Once everyone's submitted their **pull requests**, I will then merge **game-1.2** with the **main codespace** to cap things off. 

And voila! We're done. 

Neat, right?
